##Bike to Europe:##
This is a graph traversal problem that I am solving using Ruby

###Status###
Final draft but need refactoring code to make it cleaner

  Current Status:

  Input

      Start = City::Rome

      End   = City::Berlin

       bike_ride = BikeEurope.new(Start, End)

 Output 

   bike_ride.results!

   (As seen in terminal...)

    bike_europe [master] :> ruby lib/bike_europe.rb

[Rome, Torino, Lyon, Paris, Antwerp, Hamburg, Berlin]
